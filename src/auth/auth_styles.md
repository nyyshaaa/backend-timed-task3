# Authentication Styles with Spotify OAuth

A comparison of two production‑grade approaches for integrating Spotify OAuth into your app:

1. **Social‑Login‑Only** (Spotify access token as your sole auth)
2. **JWT/Session + Spotify OAuth** (your own JWT or session on top of Spotify tokens)


---

## 1. Social‑Login‑Only

### Flow Summary

1. **Login Redirect**: Client is redirected to Spotify’s `/authorize` with scopes and (optionally) PKCE parameters.
2. **Callback Exchange**: Your backend receives `code`, exchanges it for `access_token` + `refresh_token` via `/api/token`.
3. **User Identity**: Backend calls `/v1/me` with `access_token` to get `spotify_id` and (with `user-read-email` scope) `email`.
4. **Store Refresh Token**: Server persists `refresh_token` in DB keyed by `spotify_id` and sets an HTTP‑only `spotify_id` cookie.
5. **API Calls**: Frontend keeps only the short‑lived `access_token` in memory, sends it in `Authorization: Bearer` on each request.
6. **Silent Refresh**: On any 401, client calls your `/refresh` endpoint (cookie reveals `spotify_id`), obtains new `access_token`, updates in memory, and retries.

### Pros & Cons

* **✅ Pros**

  * Zero password management; onboarding is quick.
  * Frontend never holds `refresh_token`.
  * Silent automatic refresh until user revokes your app.
* **⚠️ Cons**

  * Tightly coupled to Spotify (harder to add other providers).
  * Client must handle 401→refresh→retry logic.

## 2. JWT/Session + Spotify OAuth

### Flow Summary

1. **Login Redirect & Callback**: Same initial steps (Spotify `/authorize` → `/callback`).
2. **Token Exchange & Profile**: Exchange `code` for tokens, fetch `/v1/me` for `spotify_id` and `email`.
3. **Persist & Issue JWT/Session**:

   * Persist `refresh_token` under `spotify_id` (or your own `user.id`).
   * Issue your own **JWT** (`sub`=Spotify ID or internal ID) or set a secure session cookie.
4. **Client API Calls**: Client sends **your** JWT/session cookie on each request—not the Spotify `access_token`.
5. **Server‑Side Spotify Calls**: On each request, backend dependency:

   * Validates your JWT/session → extracts user ID.
   * Looks up stored `refresh_token` → refreshes Spotify `access_token` if needed → calls Spotify APIs.
   * API calls depend on spotify token dependency which returns access token and spotify token    dependency  depends on get current user dependency(decode jwt token and get user id and check if user exists)

### Pros & Cons

* **✅ Pros**

  * Decouples your auth layer from Spotify; easier to add Google/Github later.
  * Centralized control: revoke sessions independently of Spotify.
  * Embed custom claims (roles, permissions) in your JWT.
* **⚠️ Cons**

  * Slightly more complex setup: two tokens to manage (your JWT + Spotify tokens).
  * Requires secure storage of JWT secret or session store.

## 3. When to Use PKCE

* **Standard Auth Code** with client secret is fine for server‑only (backend) flows.
* **PKCE** is mandatory when your OAuth flow originates in a public client (SPA, mobile) that cannot keep secrets.

  1. Generate `code_verifier` + `code_challenge` at `/login` and store verifier in an HTTP‑only cookie.
  2. Send `code_challenge` to `/authorize`.
  3. On `/callback`, send `code_verifier` instead of client secret.

### PKCE Analogy — DNA & Proof of Origin

* **`code_verifier`** is like a DNA sample hidden in your cell.
* **`code_challenge`** is the hashed blueprint.
* Only the original cell containing the DNA (verifier) can prove it matches the blueprint (challenge), preventing code theft.

## 4. Token Refresh Timing

| Event                | Frontend                                                         | Backend                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initial login**    | Redirect to `/login`; store `access_token` in memory             | Exchange code; fetch profile; store `refresh_token`; set cookie; issue JWT/session |
| **API request**      | Send `access_token` (social‑only) or your JWT                    | Validate token; perform operation                                                  |
| **401 Unauthorized** | (Social‑only) call `/refresh`; retry request                     | Exchange `refresh_token` → new `access_token`; return it                           |
|                      | (JWT flow) client sees auth error → clear JWT, redirect to login | —                                                                                  |
| **User revocation**  | Detect refresh failure; redirect user to login                   | Reject refresh; cleanup DB as needed                                               |

## Conclusion

* **Social‑Login‑Only**: fastest to launch, minimal server state, but provider‑tied and shifts refresh logic to client.
* **JWT/Session + Spotify OAuth**: full control, multi‑provider ready, with server‑side management of provider tokens.
* **PKCE**: add it when your client can’t hide a secret.

Choose the approach that fits your security needs, client architecture, and growth plans.
